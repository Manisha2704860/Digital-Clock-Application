# Digital-Clock-Application

- I built a digital clock web application that displays the current time and date in real-time.

- The application shows hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM format.
- It also displays the current day, date, month, and year.

- The time updates automatically every second without refreshing the page.

- HTML is used to create the structure of the clock, CSS is used to design and style the clock interface, and JavaScript is used to fetch the current system time and update it continuously.

- This project simulates a real digital clock similar to mobile or desktop clocks.
